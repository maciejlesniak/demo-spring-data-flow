== Features

* The Spring Cloud Data Flow server uses https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer/[Spring Cloud Deployer], to deploy data pipelines made of Spring Cloud Stream or Spring Cloud Task applications onto modern platforms such as Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes.
+
[CAUTION]
====
This deployer SPI has been implemented for several runtime environments:

* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer/tree/main/spring-cloud-deployer-local[Local] - Spring Cloud Local Deployer is an implementation of the Spring Cloud Deployer SPI for use to deploy applications on the same machine. This occurs by this application spawning a new JVM process for the deployed application;
+
Itâ€™s important to note that (from deployer https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer/tree/main/spring-cloud-deployer-local[readme]):

** this deployer _spawns new JVMs_ that are not monitored or maintained by this deployer;
** no attempts at high availability, fault tolerance, or resiliency are provided by the deployer;
** since the deployer SPI expects an underlying platform to provide that level of resiliency, *any use of this deployer in a production environment should be accompanied with additional monitoring at the app level* (the apps this deployer deploys). This deployer will not be updated to take on those requirements. Therefore the user is encouraged to explore the CloudFoundry and Kubernetes variants as ways to meet them;
* https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-deployer/tree/main/spring-cloud-deployer-kubernetes[Kubernetes] - A Spring Cloud Deployer implementation for deploying long-lived streaming applications and short-lived tasks to Kubernetes. It uses `KubernetesAutoConfiguration` and `io.fabric8.kubernetes.api` to create K8S containers dynamically;
* Cloud Foundry
====

* A selection of pre-built https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream-applications/[stream] (Spring Cloud Stream Applications are standalone executable applications that communicate over messaging middleware) and https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#_out_of_the_box_task_applications[task/batch] (Spring Cloud Task allows a user to develop and run short lived microservices using Spring Cloud ) starter apps for various data integration and processing scenarios facilitate learning and experimentation.
+
NOTE: Spring Cloud Stream Applications are dependency for Spring Data Flow, so you could run it independently from SDF. To run them through SDF they must be registered in SDF repository first, so they could be deployed by Skipper. The list of pre-build applications is https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications#reusable-spring-cloud-stream-applications[available on Github].

* While Data Flow includes source, processor, sink applications, you can extend these applications or write a custom https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream[Spring Cloud Stream] application. You can follow the https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/stream-developer-guides/streams/standalone-stream-sample[Stream Development guide] on the Microsite to create your own custom application. Once you have created a custom application, you can register it, as described in https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-cloud-dataflow-register-stream-apps[Register a Stream Application].

* A simple stream pipeline DSL makes it easy to specify which apps to deploy and how to connect outputs and inputs. The composed task DSL is useful for when a series of task apps require to be run as a directed graph.
+
[NOTE]
====
As a simple example, consider the collection of data from an HTTP Source and writing to a File Sink. Using the DSL, the stream description is:
[source,text]
http | file

A stream that involves some processing would be expressed as:

[source,text]
http | filter | transform | file
====

* The dashboard offers a graphical editor for building data pipelines interactively, as well as views of deployable apps and monitoring them with metrics using Wavefront, Prometheus, Influx DB, or other monitoring systems.

* The Spring Cloud Data Flow server exposes a REST API for composing and deploying data pipelines. A separate shell makes it easy to work with the API from the command line.
+
[NOTE]
====
To run shell from the demo, just do ``make dataflow-shell``. That should give you a prompt:

.Example Data Flow CLI command
[source,shell]
----
make dataflow-shell
while ! curl http://localhost:9393/dashboard </dev/null; do sleep 3; done
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-shell.jar
