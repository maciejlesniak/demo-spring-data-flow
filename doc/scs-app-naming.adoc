== Application naming

Applications follow a naming convention: <functionality>-<type>-<binder>.
For example, `rabbit-sink-kafka` is a Rabbit sink that uses the Kafka binder that is running with Kafka as the middleware.

Available Spring Cloud Stream application types:

* `source` that connects to an external resource to poll and receive data that is published to the default “output” channel;
* `processor` that receives data from an “input” channel and processes it, sending the result on the default “output” channel;
* `sink` that connects to an external resource to send the received data to the default “input” channel.

Available out-of-the-box binders:

* `kafka`
* `rabbit`
